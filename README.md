[2]A Python-based RCWA (apply for arbitrary 2D nanostructure) programme will be released soon (arXiv and Github).
Add when there is decent publication(crying)

### Notes
[1] Currently working on a note about angular momentum theory in quantum mechanics including contents about group theory and the solutions of the exercises in J.J.Sakurai's book based on the textbook of J.J.Sakurai and the textbook of Dirac and a lecture note of math dept, Moscow State University (A PDE point of view) and two lecture notes about group theory.
you can find this trivial note here(including the .tex file and to be finished):  [Theory of Angular Momentum](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e1MSU2ynOPZD74bu9zVQUS1jYZf6j7Mi)

## Random things about me: 
### Excited in Bloch mode and confined in first Brillouin zone
* Normally, I work from 7:50 am to 9:58 pm  
* Go to bed before midnight(sometimes I don't fall asleep but I pretend to), I will reply E-mail and WeChat after 7 am
* Publication can be found on arXiv
* Struggling my MSc or PhD application
* For no reason, I like penguin
* The dramma I adore most is Les Misérables
* Like you already find out, I am a big fan of Harry Potter
* Big fan of Manchester United and Jose Mourinho
* Hence do not talk about Ed Woodward
* Playstation and Switch
* 'The last of us' is most maverlous game has been ever created
* As for whom totally ruined the second part of this game, I feel utterly disgusted whatever his personal persuit is.
* I mean the writer of the game -- Neil Druckman is in NO POSITION to lecture us his own political correctness.
